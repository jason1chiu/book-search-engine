## Description
As an avid reader, my motivation is to create a robust book search engine with personalized features, allowing me to discover new books, save them for future reference, and easily manage my reading preferences and saved books. I built this project to fulfill the needs of avid readers like myself, providing a user-friendly book search engine that enables efficient discovery, organization, and tracking of books, empowering users to create personalized reading lists and enhance their overall reading experience. By developing this book search engine, I aimed to address the challenge of efficiently searching and organizing books, offering a comprehensive solution that simplifies the process of finding, saving, and managing book recommendations, ultimately enhancing the overall book discovery and reading experience for users. Through the process of building this project, I gained valuable experience in implementing a GraphQL API with Apollo Server, integrating authentication middleware, and deploying a MERN stack application to Heroku, allowing me to enhance my skills in modern web development technologies and deepen my understanding of data-driven and user-centric application design.
